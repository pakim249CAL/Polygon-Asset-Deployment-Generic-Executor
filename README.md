# Polygon Asset Deployment Executor and Proposal Deployment Script

Contains scripts to deploy a proposal payload via the cross chain bridge to the Polygon AAVE market. 

PolygonAssetListingProposalGenericExecutor is meant to be delegate called to add an asset to the Polygon market. (Still working on getting this working)

TODO:
1. Make the oracle payload work
2. Make the delegate call payload contract work so that the calldata size can be reduced
